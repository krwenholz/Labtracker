This guy goes through the compile_errors database and selects the most recent error for each student.  It uses TimeStamp to rule out old entries (in hundredths of a minute), a subtable for gathering unique method names by UserID, and then it counts the occurrences of the method names from the table.

"SELECT SUB1.methodName, COUNT(*)
			 FROM (SELECT UserID, methodName
			       FROM compile_errors C1
			       WHERE TimeStamp >= ALL(SELECT TimeStamp FROM compile_errors C2 WHERE C1.UserID = C2.UserID) AND NOW() - TimeStamp < 500) AS SUB1
			 GROUP BY SUB1.methodName
			 ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;"
